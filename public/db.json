The dish consists of pizza dough that is topped with cheese, garlic butter, and parsley.\n\nIt is baked until the cheese melts, and it can then be additionally topped with dill, vegetables, or pieces of bacon. Garlic fingers are often consumed with regular pizza as a side dish, and they are typically accompanied by dipping sauces such as Donair or marinara.",

Unlike calzone, stromboli did not originate from Italy, but supposedly from suburban Philadelphia where it was invented in the 1950s and named after one of Roberto Rossellini's movies.",

Pizza carbonara consists of a basic pizza dough covered with tomato sauce and topped with slices of salty pancetta, eggs, and cheese.
